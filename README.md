# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
In this interdisciplinary data science capstone project, my group members and I created a digital dashboard (tableau) that shows users groups of countries clustered based on country COVID-19, QS university rankings and socioeconomic index data.

## Aim
With loosened travel restrictions, we aim to help high school / undergraduate students make better decisions when choosing a university to study overseas. <br> As our country clustering system takes into account (1) COVID-19 spread, (2) country socioeconomic index, and (3) university rankings by subject, we expect our digital dashboard to help students find the most suitable countries for their study.
